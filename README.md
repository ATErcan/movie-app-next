## Lessons Learned

Next.js 13 comes into our lives with many conveniences. However, since many of its features are still in the experimental phase, the number of errors you may encounter may be quite high. 
But I can truly say that next.js 13, once built on solid foundations, will drastically change the world of web development.

## Appendix

error - SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)

If you see this error on your console for no reason, I want you to know that there is no solution for this. Just sit back and wait for an update. Or switch back to src dir.
